Build a Java app with Maven


The repository contains a simple Java application which outputs the string
"Hello world!" and is accompanied by a couple of unit tests to check that the
main application works as expected. The results of these tests are saved to a
JUnit XML report.

The `jenkins` directory contains an example of the 
`Jenkinsfile.docker` (i.e. Pipeline) you'll be creating yourself during the training for using docker as agent to run the pipeline 

`Jenkinsfile.default` (i.e. Pipeline) you'll be creating yourself during the training for using host machine as agent to run the pipeline

and the `scripts` subdirectory contains a shell script with commands that are executed when Jenkins processes
the "Deliver" stage of your Pipeline.
